        <p>Belo Horizonte is the sixth largest city in Brazil, the thirteenth largest city in South America. Belo Horizonte is the capital of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil's second most populous state. The region was first settled in the early 18th century, but the city, as it is known today, was planned and constructed in the 1890s, in order to replace Ouro Preto as the capital of Minas Gerais. The city features a mixture of contemporary and classical buildings, and is home to several modern Brazilian architectural icons, most notably the Pampulha Complex, where it is placed the NT17th venue.</p>
        <p>The city is built on several hills and is surrounded by mountains. The Mangabeiras Park (Parque das Mangabeiras), located 6 km south-east from the city center, in the hills of Curral Ridge (Serra do Curral), offers a broad view of the city (see the photo above). It has an area of 2.35 km2, of which 0.9 km2 is covered by the native forest.</p>
