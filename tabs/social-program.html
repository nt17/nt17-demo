        <p align ="justify">The Inhotim Institute is home to one of the most important contemporary art collections in Brazil, being considered the 
        greatest outdoor art complex in the world. Inhotim is located in the town of Brumadinho, MG, 60 km away from Belo Horizonte.
        Inhotim joined the Brazilian government's official botanical garden association, and the staff has begun an inventory of its
        4,500 plant species, including 1,300 types of palm alone. There are greenhouses for unusually rare plants. <br>
