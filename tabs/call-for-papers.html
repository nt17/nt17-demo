<p>
The European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA) is the premier European software architecture conference, providing researchers, practitioners, and educators with a platform to present and discuss the most recent, innovative and significant findings and experiences in the field of software architecture research and practice. The conference will feature a research track, an industrial track, an education and training track, keynotes, workshops, tutorials, tool and demonstrations, and panels. </p>

<hr>
<p>ECSA 2016 seeks three types of submissions to foster the active participation of researchers and practitioners:</p>
<p>
<div style="margin-left:5%;">
<li>Full research papers and Experience papers (max. 16 pages in LNCS style) that describe novel contributions to software architecture research (submissions should cover work that has a sound scientific/technological basis and has been validated).</li>
<li>Short papers (max. 8 pages in LNCS style) that present promising preliminary results from work-in-progress or research challenges in a topic of software architecture research (submissions should cover work that has a sound basis, but perhaps has not been validated in full).</li>
<li>Education and Training papers (max. 12 pages in LNCS style) that address challenges and best practices in in teaching and training of software architecture, such as methods, project management, and academia-industry collaborations.</li>
</div>
</p>
<p>All submitted papers will undergo a rigorous peer review process, and be selected based on originality, quality, soundness and relevance. All accepted papers will appear in the conference proceedings published by Springer-Verlag as part of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.</p>
