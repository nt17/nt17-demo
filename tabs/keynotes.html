                    Engineering cyber-physical systems â€“ A paradim shift in software architectures?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    New business models, smart data and industrial internet applications are buzzwords on the first glance. But they are a little more than just buzzwords. Examples from rather different domains like industry, banking and insurance show that software systems tend to have hybrid structures. Hybrid in as much as they contain traditional information system parts as well as cyber-physical elements. Engineering such systems benefits from agile practices and demands for evolution support and different levels of system autonomy. In this presentation we present the main  challenges of digitization, we introduce a number of instruments for constructing and operating cyber-physical systems and we sketch typical architecture examples.

                    Software Architecture Challenges and Emerging Research in Software-intensive Systems-of-Systems
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The complexity of software and the complexity of systems reliant on software have grown at a staggering rate. In particular, software-intensive systems have been rapidly evolved from being stand-alone systems in the past, to be part of networked systems in the present, to increasingly become systems-of-systems in the coming future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    De facto, the pervasiveness of the networks increasingly has made possible to interconnect software-intensive systems that were independently developed, operated, managed, and evolved, yielding a new kind of complex system, i.e. a system that is itself composed of systems, the so-called System-of-Systems (SoS). By its very nature, SoS is evolutionarily developed and exhibits emergent behavior. This is the case of SoS found in different areas as diverse as aeronautics, automotive, energy, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation; and application domains that address societal needs as e.g. environmental monitoring, emergency coordination, traffic control, smart grids, and smart cities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this talk, I will present the challenges facing software architecture research to address software-intensive systems-of-systems. I will discuss the discriminating characteristics of system-of-systems when compared with single (even very large) systems from the software architecture perspective. Specifically, I will analyze why novel architectural solutions are needed to handle the complexity of software-intensive systems-of-systems in particular regarding the architectural challenges implied by evolutionary development and emergent behavior. Finally, I will survey recent advances in software architecture research to formally describe the architecture of software-intensive systems-of-systems. I will conclude by identifying different research roadmaps and pinpointing upcoming international initiatives on software-intensive systems-of-systems.
