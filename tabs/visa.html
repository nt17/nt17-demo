 The NT17 VISA invitation letter will be made by using the  ConfTool Conference Administration System. When you create a new user account
 the Conftool system will ask if you need a Visa Invitation Letter. 
 The NT17 organizers advise you to apply for your visa as early as possible, at least 3 months prior to the 
conference.
