          Alessandro Siria is CNRS research associate at the Laboratoire de Physique Statistique de l’Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris. 
          His research interests are at the interface between various domains: solid state physics, nanoscience and soft condensed 
          matter. He develops unique experimental set-ups for the investigation of the ionic and fluid transport in nanochannels and to
          address the microscopic origin of friction and dissipation. He has received a European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant
          for the period 2015-2020 and he is co-founder of Sweetch Energy company aiming a the industrialization of new fluidic 
          membranes for the harvesting of salinity gradient energy.

          Mark C. Hersam is the Walter P. Murphy Professor of Materials Science and Engineering and Director of the Materials Research
          Center at Northwestern University. He also holds faculty appointments in the Departments of Chemistry, Applied Physics, 
          Medicine, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. His research interests include nanofabrication, scanning probe 
          microscopy, semiconductor surfaces, and nanoelectronic materials. As a faculty member, Dr. Hersam has received several awards 
          including the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, TMS Robert Lansing Hardy Award, AVS Peter Mark 
          Award, MRS Outstanding Young Investigator Award, MacArthur Fellowship, and six Teacher of the Year Awards. Dr. Hersam is the 
          co-founder of NanoIntegris, which is a commercial supplier of high performance nanoelectronic materials. Dr. Hersam is a 
          Fellow of MRS, AVS, APS, AAAS, SPIE, and IEEE, and also acts as an Associate Editor of ACS Nano. Dr. Hersam is currently 
          serving as a U.S. Science Envoy to help inform the White House, the Department of State, and the scientific community about
          potential opportunities for international scientific cooperation.

          Michael S. Arnold is currently an Associate Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at the University of
	  Wisconsin-Madison. There, he has directed the Advanced Materials for Energy and Electronics Group since 2008. Arnold’s
          research program focuses on the fundamental materials science of carbon nanomaterials (nanotubes, graphene, and related 
	  nanostructures). His work addresses scientific challenges – in controlling the growth, processing, ordering, and heterogeneity
	  of carbon nanomaterials and in understanding phenomena beyond the scale of single nanostructures – that must be overcome to 
	  exploit these materials in (opto)electronics technology. Arnold has been a recipient of the U.S. National Science Foundation
	  CAREER award (2014); the American Chemical Society Arthur K. Doolittle Award in Polymeric Materials Science and Engineering 
	  (2012); the U.S. Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) – nominated by the U.S. Department of 
	  Defense, Army Research Office (2011); the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Early Career Research Award (2011); and a 3M 
	  Non-Tenured Faculty Award (2011, 2012, 2013)

          Steve received his B.S. degree with honors in Chemistry from the University of Wisconsin.  M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Physical 
          Chemistry were earned at Northwestern University.  Following his work as a Directors Postdoctoral Fellow at Los Alamos
          National Laboratory, Steve has continued on as a staff member for ~25 years.  He is currently the Thrust Leader for the 
          Nanophotonics and Optical Nanomaterials research thrust within the DOE Office of Science Center for Integrated
          Nanotechnologies. Steve’s research efforts have included development of SERS-active nanoparticles for bioanalytical 
          applications and a focus on chemistry and spectroscopy of carbon nanomaterials, including Raman and photoluminescence 
          spectroscopy of carbon nanotubes and graphene, covalent and non-covalent functionalization and surface chemistry of nanotubes,
          and their separations.  Current efforts include exciton photophysics, chemistry, and quantum optical behaviors of 
          covalently-introduced carbon nanotube defect sites. Among his awards, Steve is the recipient of the LANL Fellows Prize for
          Research, the DOE Office of Science Mentor Award, and is a Fellow of the American Physical Society.
