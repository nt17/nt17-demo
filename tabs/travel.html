<p ALIGN="justify"><strong>Wheather </strong><br>
    Belo Horizonte is a 850m hight city, with temperatures ranging from 13 - 25 degrees Celcius in June. 
    June is the coolest and driest season of the year. There is no earthquake, hurricane or other extreme natural phenomena.</p>
		
<p ALIGN="justify"><strong>Security</strong><br>
Here is our testimony: Yes, there are security issues in Brazil, but when comparing large and touristic cities in Brazil,
Belo Horizonte is among the safest. Children don't usually go alone on the streest, mostly because our feeling is that 
trafic is not mild enough. However, people go out at night and have fun, like everywhere. We never had ourselve and do 
not know any Brazilian who had stuff robed from their hotel rooms in Brazil. Still, anyway, you should be careful when
crossing streets, carriying large camaras, taking to strangers, etc. 
</p>

<p ALIGN="justify"><strong>Currency Exchange</strong><br>	
Only Real (R$ or BRL) is acceptable as currency at stores and restaurants. You can exchange money at the airport or at the bank. 
Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) can be found at the airport and throughout the city. (The plural for Real is Reais)
