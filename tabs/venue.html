Agricultural Sciences and the Veterinary farms outside the city. 
UFMG offers a wide range of museums and places of scientific and cultural interest, such as the Cultural Centre, the UFMG Conservatory,
the Natural History Museum, the Botanical Gardens and the Museum of Morphological Science, all of which are open to the public.
In addition, it organizes major arts events, such as the Winter and Summer Festivals.The three organizers belong to the Physics
Department at UFMG. The Department has 74 Professors and around 200 graduate students, fully engaged in science, with top level 
ranking from the Brazilian Funding Agency for Graduate Program CAPES. The Department is considerably focused in materials science, 
with a large number of professors working with nanostructures. The UFMG also counts with Chemistry, Biology and Engineering
courses, including hundreds of professors, and a considerable number working in the field of carbon nanotube, graphene and other low dimensional materials. The UFMG professors 
lead the two most important Brazilian projects in the carbon nanotube field, which are the National Institute of Science and Technology 
in Carbon Nanostructures, and the Technology Center for Carbon Nanotubes. The first puts together, annually, hundreds of researchers from
all over Brazil to discuss science and to have some fun together.
