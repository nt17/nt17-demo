            Security-related incidents are increasing, and at the same time our society is increasingly relying on cyber-physical systems. Systematic approaches to monitor and measure security are needed to build secure systems, including IoT and cloud services, and to offer security evidence for system designers and users. Security analysis and measuring on software architecture level produces evidence of security in the design phase, to deal with requirement trade-offs. Architecture-level security analysis supports “security by design”. On the other hand, to understand overall security status and get a holistic view, architecture-level security analysis has to be extended to the operational system domain, and needs to include also the network level security monitoring and analysis. Thus, techniques to understand and scale the needs in both measurement and analytics are needed. Together these are able to provide the basis for security situational awareness in the modern complex software infrastructure. Security metrics also support security adaptation and architecture-based evolution.

            The WEA Workshop series is a venue for both practitioners and researchers discussing problems, solutions and lessons learned related to software development in the context of multiple systems which are inter-dependent, interrelated or integrated. The goal of the workshop series is to define challenges and find solutions for managers, engineers, integrators, and architects who work in such open-source or industrial ecosystems. We solicit submissions on technical topics related to scaling system architecture to the level of software ecosystems. What are relevant methods, processes, techniques and/or tools for architecting at scale? Which technical strategies are required to cope with the complexity of ecosystem architectures? How can architectural concepts assure end-to-end quality across system borders while keeping maintenance and evolution of the comprising systems independent from each other? What kind of capabilities do we need in terms of tools to analyze software ecosystems statically or monitor/diagnose them at run time?
        </p>
        <p>
            We envision a high-quality technical program due a thorough reviewing process. Participants can expect to benefit from interesting and fruitful discussions, exchange their experiences, meet researchers working in the same area, and make new friends. The technical program shall cover a wide range of current research that pertains to technologies and architecture of software ecosystem.

                The goal of the SAGRA workshop is to develop a future vision and roadmap of sustainable software architectures, focusing especially on requirements engineering and methodological analysis, as well as on collaborative and intercultural aspects. The workshop aims to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners from academia and industry to baseline the state of the art in this increasingly important domain.</p>
            <p>
                There are numerous challenges, and rewards, in the development of software architectures. Unsustainable, low-quality architectures perplex collaboration, slow the progress of software evolution and reduce profits. It is crucial for software systems to be sustainable, i.e. to be cost-efficiently maintained and evolved over their entire life-cycle, whereas the sustainability of the system is largely determined by the sustainability of its architecture. Designing a sustainable software architecture is a non-trivial task, especially in the case of large-scale and/or long-living systems. The task becomes even more complicated when we take into account collaborative and intercultural aspects of the software development, requirements traceability and big data management.

                <br>
                <p>
                    We propose to co-locate our workshop with the European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA), since it is the premier European software architecture conference, providing researchers, practitioners, and educators to present and discuss the most recent, innovative and significant findings and experiences in the field of software architecture research and practice. Our workshop fits with the following topics proposed in the main conference: foundational principles of software architecture; quality attributes and software architectures; architectural design, analysis and evaluation, architecture-based evolution, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The workshop brings together software architecture researchers and practitioners, and provides a forum for discussing and critically analysing ongoing research and emerging results on sustainability aspects of software architecture. Previous iteration of the workshop showed that there is interest in collaborations and discussions on this topics, and that there are now more questions than answers in this field. The workshop organisers are involved in research in this area and hope to build a community around this topic.

            Several frameworks have been proposed to help the designers of software system applications. However, we currently lack methodological tool support to take into account the interplay between security and safety and the other architecture properties. The main focus of ISSA workshop is on the topic of making security and safety expert knowledge available to system and software engineering processes. Special emphasis will be devoted to promote discussion and interaction between researchers and practitioners focused on the particularly challenging task to efficiently integrate security and safety solutions within the restricted available design space for software systems. Furthermore, one important focus is on the potential benefits of the combination of model-driven engineering, formal methods with pattern-based representation of security and safety solutions. Some of the topics that we seek to include in the workshop are related to the development of concepts, modeling languages, evaluation and validation techniques, methods and tools to support the inclusion of security, safety and architecture issues into the software engineering process. We are inviting the submission of papers with high quality research contributions, work in progress, challenge problems, tool demonstrations, experimental and ongoing projects results.

            Software architecture erosion can negatively impact on the quality attributes associated with the intended architecture and lead to systems that are increasingly difficult to maintain. Studies suggest that such erosion is prevalent, yet under-studied. This workshop aims to address this issue focusing on the technical challenges of recovering intended architectures, on the detection/quantification of erosion, and on strategies for avoiding or resolving erosion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The intended audience is researchers in software maintenance, software architecture and model-driven/round-trip engineering. It is a 2-day format where the first day is dedicated to exploring Open Source Architectures with 2 guest Open Source architects. Here researchers will be able to evaluate the efficacy of their approaches to architecture recovery/consistency and to obtain reference architectures for the Open Source systems. The 2nd day is dedicated to a more traditional workshop style where academic papers are presented. However, in the tradition of SAEroCon, papers will be delivered by other participants (not the authors), with the authors given a right-to-respond opportunity after the presentation. This format aims to foster increased interaction and discussion.
